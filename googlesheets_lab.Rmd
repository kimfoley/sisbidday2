```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(googlesheets)
```

2. Open Google spreadsheet
```{r, chunk2}
sheets_url = "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/103vUoftv2dLNZ_FcAz08b5ptIkWN4W2RaFn7VF39FJ8"
gsurl1 = gs_url(sheets_url)
dat = gs_read(gsurl1)
head(dat)
```

3. Look at arguments for cell_rows, cell_limits, cell_cols (this opens a website so i took it out)
```{r, chunk 3, include=FALSE}
#?gs_read
```

4. Read in first two columns
```{r, chunk4}
dat_short = gs_read(gsurl1, range=cell_cols(1:2))
dat_short
```

5. How many students have added their info?
```{r chunk5}
nrow(dat)
```

6. Logical var for whether students have more than 2 years of R experience
```{r, chunk 6}
dat$rexp <- as.numeric(dat$"Years of R experience")
morethan2 <- as.numeric(dat$'Years of R experience') > 2
morethan2
```
